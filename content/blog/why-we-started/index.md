We build  <a href="https://bulksms.roycetechnologies.co.ke/" target="_blank">Royce bulk sms</a> for one reason to enable developer to integrate bulk sms into any system in under 2 minutes. Let me tell you my story. I discovered  my passion for software development in my 2rd year, I tried a couple of programming languages and later settled on PHP. By 3 rd I got some cash developing projects for my classmates fastforward to after graduation. I got a gig to do a system that needed to bulk sms integration. I googled how to integrate bulk sms into a system and I came to a new term API, it really scared me and almost gave up on the job. I was saved by a guy only after parting with some cash then another challange came in the client wanted a way to view message delivery status and send bulk sms within the application itself. 2 years after that I came to learn about laravel and how you can convert you most used functionality into a reusable package. Thats how royce bulk sms was born. Our idea is to have a packages/ modules for all programming languages and framworks. Below are our products.
